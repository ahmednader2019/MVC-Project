# MVC-Project


"In my project, I attempted to construct a lightweight framework inspired by the Laravel framework. This framework adheres to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. The primary focus of the project is a dynamic dashboard that facilitates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Notably, the dashboard offers users the choice of selecting from two distinct themes, enhancing the user experience and aesthetic appeal."
